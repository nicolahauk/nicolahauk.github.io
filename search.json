    "text": "The NWSL is the first women’s soccer league with a stadium built specifically for their women’s team and the USWNT has the most World Cup wins followed by Germany with two wins which is only half than the United States. The growth of the viewership and the recent record-breaking signings in the United States hint that all the best female soccer players want to play in the NWSL as it seems to be the best league in the world.\nBut the hype around women’s soccer has not only spread over the US. Some of the most successful leagues in women’s soccer are the NWSL, the WSL, the Bundesliga, the Division 1 Feminine and the A-League, considering the entrees into the international competitions and the growth of the sport in each of these countries. The other countries are catching up with the NWSL and questioning the superiority of the NWSL.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nWSLBasic21 &lt;- read_csv(\"WSL/WSL 20-21 basic stats.csv\") |&gt;

Does that mean some of the best players in the world suddenly can’t score anymore? No, it’s just harder to score because the defensive abilities within the NWSL might be higher compared to all the other leagues. The NWSL is known as one of the most physically demanding leagues because academy teams start to get players into the weight room a lot earlier than anywhere else in the world. Academies in England or Germany focus on tactical and technical development more than most other countries. This leads to different playing and defending styles in different countries.\n\n\nCode\nTop5defpast4 &lt;- bind_rows(AussieDefpast4, BLDefpast2, FemDefpast3,NWSLDefpast3, WSLDefpast4)\n\ntop5Tkl &lt;- Top5defpast4 |&gt; top_n(5, wt=`Tkl%`)\ntop20Int &lt;- Top5defpast4 |&gt; top_n(20, wt= Int)\ntop20shblock &lt;- Top5defpast4 |&gt; top_n(20, wt= ShBlocks)\nToptackleteam &lt;- Top5defpast4|&gt; group_by(Country)|&gt; filter(`Tkl%` == max(`Tkl%`))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=Top5defpast4, \n    aes(x=DuelLost, y=TklW, size=`Tkl%`, color=Country), \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(data=Toptackleteam, aes(x=DuelLost, y=TklW, size=`Tkl%`), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 145.2554  ) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 251.6467) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=220, y=170, label=\"low tackles, bad duels\"), color=\"grey\", alpha=1) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=80, y=340, label=\"high tackles, good duels\"), color=\"grey\", alpha=1) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=Toptackleteam, \n    aes(x=DuelLost, y=TklW, label=SquadSeason)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#00843D\", \"#000040\", \"#2FAEE0\",\"#ffce00\",\"#BB2533\")) +\n  scale_size_continuous(name=\"Tackle %\", range = c(1,5))+\n  labs(x = \"Lost Duels\", y =\"Tackles won\", title=\"Every league differenciates in styles of defending\", subtitle=\"The WSL and the Bundesliga are physically in duels the opposite of the NWSL,\\nwhile the Division 1 Feminine and the A-League are spread all across the defending styles.\", caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Nicola Hauk\")  + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining what makes a league better than another is crucial to find out what the best league in the world is. Looking at the basic stats, soccer is based on goals scored and goals conceded, but the outcome of a game is based on many other moments within the 90-minute game. Do French, German and English teams score more goals because they attack better or because the opponent defends bad? The only times where the different playing styles clash are during international competitions. When the physical strength of one country meets the technical finesse of another or the tactical organization of a third.\n\n\nCode\ntop20 &lt;- Top5basicpast4 |&gt; \n  top_n(20, wt=Gls) |&gt; \n  mutate(CL = case_when(\n    SquadSeason == \"Lyon 2022\" ~ \"Winner\",\n    SquadSeason == \"Wolfsburg 2023\" ~ \"Runner-Up\",\n    SquadSeason == \"Chelsea 2021\" ~ \"Runner-Up\",\n    TRUE ~ \"No Champions League final\"\n  ) \n)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(SquadSeason, Gls), weight=Gls, fill=CL)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"lightgrey\", \"lightblue\", \"darkblue\"))+\n   labs(\n    x=\"Squad\", \n    y=\"Goals scored per Season\", \n    title=\"Offense wins games - Defense wins championships\", \n    subtitle=\"In the past four years only one of the highest scoring teams in the world won the Champions League.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Nicola Hauk\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Champions League and in the national team competitions the field gets tighter every year. One of the leagues has the most dangerous attacking teams, one is the strongest competition, one is the calmest in possession and another is unbeatable in their defensive organization. Not one of these qualities guarantees the win of the Champions League and because of these differences the best players in the world are playing in various leagues fitting their playing style and abilities. Women’s soccer is growing all over the world and the international competition is visibly closer in every World Cup."

    "text": "The premier league season is coming to an end. After 35 game weeks of competition, Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal are the favorites for the title. Each of those teams has their own strengths and weaknesses. While Arsenal is the highest scoring team on set pieces, Manchester City finally is back in form with Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland coming back from injuries. A couple weeks ago, Jürgen Klopp, who has been the Liverpool head coach since 2015, announced his retirement. The fans are heartbroken over the news, but the hope is that he can be sent off with another trophy in his hand.\nManchester City, lead by manager Pep Guardiola, is the perfect mix of experienced players and young talent and has come out on top in many title races in Premier League history. Liverpool had an outstanding year even though they battelled injuries from up to 11 players at a time. A lot of young players have stepped up and quickly adjusted to the high-pressure environment. Unlike the other two contestant, Arsenal hasn’t won a title since 2004. While they are not used to dealing with the pressure of the title race, they have been the most constant over the last couple game weeks.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nPL24 &lt;- fb_season_team_stats(\"ENG\", \"M\", 2024, \"1st\", \"league_table\")\nPL23 &lt;- fb_season_team_stats(\"ENG\", \"M\", 2023, \"1st\", \"league_table\")\nPL22 &lt;- fb_season_team_stats(\"ENG\", \"M\", 2022, \"1st\", \"league_table\")\nPL21 &lt;- fb_season_team_stats(\"ENG\", \"M\", 2021, \"1st\", \"league_table\")\nPLbasic &lt;- fb_season_team_stats(\"ENG\", \"M\", 2020:2024, \"1st\", \"league_table\")\nPLshooting &lt;- fb_season_team_stats(\"ENG\", \"M\", 2021:2024, \"1st\", \"shooting\")\nfootball &lt;- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year=2021:2024,stat_type=\"defense\",team_or_player=\"team\")\nPLdefense &lt;- football |&gt; filter(Comp==\"Premier League\")\n\ncurrentleague &lt;- PLbasic |&gt; \n  filter(Squad != \"Leeds United\")|&gt;\n  filter(Squad !=\"Leicester City\") |&gt;\n  filter(Squad != \"Norwich City\") |&gt;\n  filter(Squad != \"Southampton\") |&gt;\n  filter(Squad != \"Watford\")\n\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bump(data= currentleague, aes(x=Season_End_Year, y=Rk, color = Squad))+\n  geom_point(data= currentleague, aes(x=Season_End_Year, y=Rk, color = Squad), size=5)+\n  geom_text(data= currentleague, aes(x=Season_End_Year, y=Rk, label=Pts), size=3) + \n  geom_text(data = currentleague |&gt; filter(Season_End_Year == min(Season_End_Year)), aes(x = Season_End_Year - .2, y=Rk, label = Squad), size = 2.5, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = currentleague |&gt; filter(Season_End_Year == max(Season_End_Year)), aes(x = Season_End_Year + .2, y=Rk, label = Squad), size = 2.5, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#9C824A\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"#C8102E\", \"grey\", \"#6CABDD\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\", \"grey\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024), limits=c(2019.2, 2025)) + \n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20))+\n  labs(\n    x= element_blank(),\n    y= \"Rank\", \n    title=\"Building the success over time\", \n    subtitle=\"Arsenal started the journey to the title five years ago from place 8.

The Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world, so most games finish with a one or two goal margin. The success Arsenal had this season mostly comes from great set plays. With close games, smart tactical play and organized defenses, the game often comes down to a set play chance. The majority of goals are scored either in transition or on a set play because the individual level and team tactics have advanced a lot. With Arsenal being the best team on set plays in the league, they gain an advantage in those tight games.

While the tactical plan of a coach usually stays similar throughout a season, the teams have to adapt to specific opponents and play to the opponents’ weaknesses.\n\n\nCode\npointspergame &lt;- tm_matchday_table(country_name=\"England\", start_year=\"2023\", matchday=c(20:38))\nArsenal &lt;- pointspergame|&gt;\n  filter(squad == \"Arsenal\" | squad == \"Bournemouth\" | squad == \"Man Utd\" | squad == \"Everton\")\nLiverpool &lt;- pointspergame|&gt;\n  filter(squad == \"Liverpool\" | squad == \"Tottenham\" | squad == \"Aston Villa\" | squad == \"Wolves\")\nMC &lt;- pointspergame|&gt;\n  filter(squad == \"Man City\" | squad == \"Wolves\" | squad == \"Fulham\" | squad == \"Tottenham\" | squad == \"West Ham\")\n\nline1 &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_line(data= pointspergame, aes(x= matchday, y=pts, color = squad))+\n  geom_text(data = Arsenal |&gt; filter(matchday == max(matchday)), aes(x = matchday + .2, y=pts, label = squad), size = 2, hjust = 0)+\n  labs(y= \"Points\", x = \"Matchday\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#9C824A\", \"lightgrey\", \"gold\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"gold\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"gold\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(30,35), limits=c(30,40))\n\nline2 &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_line(data= pointspergame, aes(x= matchday, y=pts, color = squad))+\n  geom_text(data = Liverpool |&gt; filter(matchday == max(matchday)), aes(x = matchday + .2, y=pts, label = squad), size = 2, hjust = 0)+\n  labs(y= \"Points\", x = \"Matchday\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"lightgrey\", \"pink\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"#C8102E\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"pink\", \"pink\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(30,35), limits=c(30,40))\n\nline3 &lt;- ggplot()+\n  geom_line(data= pointspergame, aes(x= matchday, y=pts, color = squad))+\n  geom_text(data = MC |&gt; filter(matchday == max(matchday)), aes(x = matchday + .2, y=pts, label = squad), size = 2, hjust = 0)+\n  labs(y= \"Points\", x = \"Matchday\")+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightblue\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"#6CABDD\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\", \"lightblue\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(30,35), limits=c(30,40))\n\nline1 + line2 + line3 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"An adventage in the final weeks of the titlerace\",\n    subtitle = \"Going into the last three weeks of competition Manchester City has a double gameweek coming up,\\nbut Arsenal is the only top three team without a top 5 opponent in the end of the Season.\",\n    caption = \"Source: WorldfootballR | By Nicola Hauk\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the stats, Liverpool is falling behind in the title race with an increasing point gap. It will come down to who can keep up the pace. Manchester City has it in their own hands, coming up on top if they manage to win all their last four games. Can they win a fourth title in a row, or will Arsenal come through and win their first title since 2004?"
