    "text": "The NWSL is the first women’s soccer league with a stadium built specifically for their women’s team and the USWNT has the most World Cup wins followed by Germany with two wins which is only half than the United States. The growth of the viewership and the recent record-breaking signings in the United States hint that all the best female soccer players want to play in the NWSL as it seems to be the best league in the world.\nBut the hype around women’s soccer has not only spread over the US. Some of the most successful leagues in women’s soccer are the NWSL, the WSL, the Bundesliga, the Division 1 Feminine and the A-League, considering the entrees into the international competitions and the growth of the sport in each of these countries. The other countries are catching up with the NWSL and questioning the superiority of the NWSL.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nWSLBasic21 &lt;- read_csv(\"WSL/WSL 20-21 basic stats.csv\") |&gt;

Does that mean some of the best players in the world suddenly can’t score anymore? No, it’s just harder to score because the defensive abilities within the NWSL might be higher compared to all the other leagues. The NWSL is known as one of the most physically demanding leagues because academy teams start to get players into the weight room a lot earlier than anywhere else in the world. Academies in England or Germany focus on tactical and technical development more than most other countries. This leads to different playing and defending styles in different countries.\n\n\nCode\nTop5defpast4 &lt;- bind_rows(AussieDefpast4, BLDefpast2, FemDefpast3,NWSLDefpast3, WSLDefpast4)\n\ntop5Tkl &lt;- Top5defpast4 |&gt; top_n(5, wt=`Tkl%`)\ntop20Int &lt;- Top5defpast4 |&gt; top_n(20, wt= Int)\ntop20shblock &lt;- Top5defpast4 |&gt; top_n(20, wt= ShBlocks)\nToptackleteam &lt;- Top5defpast4|&gt; group_by(Country)|&gt; filter(`Tkl%` == max(`Tkl%`))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=Top5defpast4, \n    aes(x=DuelLost, y=TklW, size=`Tkl%`, color=Country), \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(data=Toptackleteam, aes(x=DuelLost, y=TklW, size=`Tkl%`), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 145.2554  ) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 251.6467) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=220, y=170, label=\"low tackles, bad duels\"), color=\"grey\", alpha=1) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=80, y=340, label=\"high tackles, good duels\"), color=\"grey\", alpha=1) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=Toptackleteam, \n    aes(x=DuelLost, y=TklW, label=SquadSeason)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#00843D\", \"#000040\", \"#2FAEE0\",\"#ffce00\",\"#BB2533\")) +\n  scale_size_continuous(name=\"Tackle %\", range = c(1,5))+\n  labs(x = \"Lost Duels\", y =\"Tackles won\", title=\"Every league differenciates in styles of defending.\", subtitle=\"The WSL and the Bundesliga are physically in duels the opposite of the NWSL, while the Division 1 Feminine\\nand the A-League are spread all across the defending styles\", caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Nicola Hauk\")  + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining what makes a league better than another is crucial to find out what the best league in the world is. Looking at the basic stats, soccer is based on goals scored and goals conceded, but the outcome of a game is based on many other moments within the 90-minute game. Do French, German and English teams score more goals because they attack better or because the opponent defends bad? The only times where the different playing styles clash are during international competitions. When the physical strength of one country meets the technical finesse of another or the tactical organization of a third.\n\n\nCode\ntop20 &lt;- Top5basicpast4 |&gt; \n  top_n(20, wt=Gls) |&gt; \n  mutate(CL = case_when(\n    SquadSeason == \"Lyon 2022\" ~ \"Winner\",\n    SquadSeason == \"Wolfsburg 2023\" ~ \"Runner-Up\",\n    SquadSeason == \"Chelsea 2021\" ~ \"Runner-Up\",\n    TRUE ~ \"No Champions League final\"\n  ) \n)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(SquadSeason, Gls), weight=Gls, fill=CL)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"lightgrey\", \"lightblue\", \"darkblue\"))+\n   labs(\n    x=\"Squad\", \n    y=\"Goals scored per Season\", \n    title=\"Offense wins games - Defense wins championships\", \n    subtitle=\"In the past four years only one of the highest scoring teams in the world won the Champions League.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Nicola Hauk\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Champions League and in the national team competitions the field gets tighter every year. One of the leagues has the most dangerous attacking teams, one is the strongest competition, one is the calmest in possession and another is unbeatable in their defensive organization. Not one of these qualities guarantees the win of the Champions League and because of these differences the best players in the world are playing in various leagues fitting their playing style and abilities. Women’s soccer is growing all over the world and the international competition is visibly closer in every World Cup."
